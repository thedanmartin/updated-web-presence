        <h2>Now</h2>

        <p>

        I'm a first year student in the <a href="http://humansciences.iit.edu/humanities/programs/graduate-programs/master-science-technical-communication-and-information-design">
        Technical Communication and Information Design</a> M.S. program
        at Illinois Institute of Technology. This semester I'm taking courses in Standards-Based Web
        Design (COM 530) and Knowledge Management (COM 542). I'm also a Teaching Assistant for History
        of World Architecture (AAH 119) and the book review assistant for <a href="http://www.hopos.org/journalinfo.html">HOPOS Journal</a>.

        <h2>Then</h2>

        <p>

        I used to work for the <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals.html">University of Chicago Press Journals Division</a>
        in a variety of production
        roles. My undergraduate time was spent at <a href="http://www.mtu.edu">Michigan Technological University</a>. I'm originally
        from Houghton, Michigan, but I've lived in Chicago for 10 years.

        <h2>Also Now</h2>

        <p>

        I'm interested in learning about all types of publishing technologies, open access publishing,
        web forums, geography, and whatever else ya got.

        In my spare time I like watching hockey or soccer, listening to music, riding my bike, and
        making/eating food.

        You can find me on the internet all over the place, but specifically on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/0dpmartin0">Twitter</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/thedanmartin">Github</a>.

        Sometimes you can find me IRL in 200 Siegel Hall on IIT's campus.
